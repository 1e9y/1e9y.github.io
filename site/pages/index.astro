      I am a seasoned software engineer and team leader, an occasional writer,
      and an amateur baker. A lifelong learner and daydreamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love building things. My primary tools are TypeScript, Node.js, and Go,
      and I specialize in creating scalable and resilient web applications using
      a modern web stack. I thrive on developing and delivering services that
      bring real value to businesses and their customers.

      If you have an interesting project or startup idea, feel free to send me a
      message. I'm always happy to talk!
